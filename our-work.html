        <h1>What We Do</h1>

        <p>
            The <b>Mediatization Lab</b> takes an innovative approach to studying how data-driven social media platforms and mobile technologies shape users' digital lives, personal experiences, and the broader political landscape.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In our collaborative lab, media researchers work alongside scholars from political communication, science and technology studies (STS), and computer science to develop creative, interdisciplinary approaches. The team integrates qualitative analysis with <b>Screenomics</b>, using <b>Screensight</b> to track and understand how people engage with digital platforms, enabling us to uncover new insights about the media's influence on public perception and conversation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Screensight</b> is an advanced data collection tool that records and analyzes users' on-screen activity, enabling continuous study of interaction patterns and content exposure over time. Researchers gain hands-on experience with <b>Screensight</b>, preparing them to apply this tool in diverse projects and deepen their understanding of mediatized violence, platform politics, and global communication. The lab's collaborative environment fosters innovative solutions informed by diverse perspectives.

            Its current project, “Minority Conservatism and Mobile Media Environments,” explores the media practices of today's multiracial coalition of conservative Americans and their engagement with political narratives within digital media spaces. The project focuses on mapping user interaction patterns and assessing the impact of algorithmic content modifications, which are automated system changes that personalize content based on user behavior and preferences. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research, the project seeks to deepen understanding of the mechanisms that influence political viewpoints.

        <p>
            Through interdisciplinary research, the lab examines the media infrastructures that underpin contemporary global challenges.
