Our work examines how mobile devices and social platforms mediate violence, influence politics, and transform how people connect, communicate, and understand the world and themselves.</p>

        <h1>Our Focus</h1>

        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em>Mediatized Violence</em></h3>
        <p>We study how violence is mediated, circulated, received, and made sense of across mobile and platform-based media, and how it shapes public feeling, perception, and participation: what we fear, care about, feel compelled to act on, and how we take action.</p>

        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em>Platform Politics and Governance</em></h3>
        <p>We examine mobile user cultures and the everyday contexts of mediatized political life — from underrepresented voices to far-right movements. We are particularly interested in how mobile cultures, platform design and governance, and institutional politics intersect.</p>

        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em>Global Comparative</em></h3>
        <p>We trace how major media events are constructed, circulated, and interpreted across digital platforms and transnational contexts. Our research explores how mobile information becomes stories and shared—or contested—narratives in a world of constant connection and updating.</p>
